Timber,"So I have two options.. first.. I sell Isak and Bruno for Larsen and Saka.. but I keep Mbeumo.. thanks to that in GW15 I buy Trent for Konate.

Second option.. I sell Mbeumo and Bruno for Rogers and Saka. (I keep Isak) and in GW15 I buy Timber for Konate. (No Liverpool def)

Solanke being out not ideal. Nice to have Trent in place. Plan is a 3rd Liverpool and Arsenal by GW15/16

Saka is the best Arsenal asset in FPL! But if you really can't afford him Odegaard and Havertz are the way forward for the attacking spots 🔥

Green Arrow streak broke. Red arrow and OR down by 52 k.

Red arrow was inevitable as soon as I put captaincy on JP. Mazraoui sub at 55 min mark hurt. 

Colwil, Gabriel, Bruno, Palmer, Salah and Havertz returned for the team.
