Gabriel is probably the only arsenal defender I would own now in FPL. I would sell Saliba / Timber / Raya 🤔

Raya,"FPL GW20 Recap

✨ Points: 68
📈 Rank: 4.6M ➡️ 4.4M

🔹 Only three attacking players delivered returns.
🔹 A great call to bench Raya for Sels, my only defensive player to keep a clean sheet!

Saliba,"Where do I go from here?! 1FT.
Was thinking Jackson &gt; Mateta but do I really want to drop Bryan or wissa vs city’s defence atm. Or Saliba to Munoz!? But which DEF do I drop?! #FPLCommunity #FPL #GW21 https://t.co/4T4HdTtTje",2025-01-05,2025-01-14,Mon Jan 06 10:43:05 +0000 2025,18,21,2,249,0,False
Saliba,"#FPLCommunity Need help making a decision.

Surely I can’t start Mazroaui this week, Southampton (H) but 11 points in 9 games is shocking. 

Didn’t even realise he was that bad of an asset 😭

Saliba, Kerkez, Maz, Munoz and Robinson. 

What back 3 would you guys go for.

Ødegaard➡️Bruno, do I use other FT to do Saliba to Munoz?🤔

Saliba,"Probably an easy roll for me this week.
Could sell Saliba but I have hall to come in and play this week.
Getting to 5 free transfers again before the busy period with doubles and blanks feels good. Hopefully get confirmation for the Liverpool double soon as well.

Saliba,"Made my early transfer🔃
 I’ve took Saliba out and transferred in Ola Aina I will bench him this week as they play Liverpool but then he’s a guaranteed starter week in week out, top scoring defender, clean sheets, assists, even a goal or two in him!

Saliba,"Question for the #FPLCommunity 

Who’s the better option this week? 

Both at home, obviously fixture favours Maz but with 11 points from his last 9 weeks I’m worried. Saliba could have better attacking threat also?
