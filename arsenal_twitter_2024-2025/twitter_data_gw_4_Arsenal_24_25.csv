White,"GW4 🔒 

I would never thought with 3free transfers I’d take a -4 and doing that 2weeks ahead the games start

1. Nkunku -&gt; Rogers 
2. Gibbs-White -&gt; PALMER 🥶 
3. Isak -&gt; JOÃO PEDRO 
4. Burn -&gt; Mykolenko

I had to to the 4th transfer because I was 0.1m short.

🆓️ 2FT
💰 £2.0M
🔁 Smith Rowe to Eze

💭 Sunday means planning. Likely bringing in Eze, but I'm open to swapping Isak to Watkins subject to injury news

Son to Palmer is an option, but I really like Spurs' run until GW11

Armstrong to Pedro also on the cards

Saliba,"✅ A great start with 72, 78, and 86 points!

Bus team for GW4 now with Eze in and Bernardo out. A second FT would likely see Saliba out for a Liverpool defender.

Highly unlikely to wildcard owing to lack of clear Aston Villa picks.

Onwards ! 🔥🔥🔥

I definitely like the look of this squad. Brentford triple up could be a whole new way of experiencing pain in this game, and I will be there 

Everyone will go Porro + Havertz, so Saliba + Solanke is some fun risk

2 FTs and the option of going Saka to Salah in GW5 and wildcarding in GW6 feels better. 💪
