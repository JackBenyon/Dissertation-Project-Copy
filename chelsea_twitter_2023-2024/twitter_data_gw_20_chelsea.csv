Thoughts 🤔:

Yet again I managed to chose the wrong GK, Petrovic with 10p on the bench 🤣. Defence was great this week &amp; Saka was a massive troll in an 5-0 win 🥶. But decent GW overall! 🔥

Petrović,"Chelsea's main man is definitely Palmer.   

Most of their attacks are orchestrated from the right and Palmer takes central positions at times too.  

But I think Petrovic is going unnoticed. Can be great differential, returning 10 points in last GW. 

Considering?

That's it, only 4 right now!

OR: 250,126➡️198,438

First hit of the season pays off massively, Porro an absolute machine and I’m so glad to have him.  Gusto and Garnacho ensure one of my favourite GWs of the season. Will most likely bring in another striker for Erling next week.

Gusto,"Gusto at £4.1 million is a complete no brainer, and that's why I was one of the 1% that moved quick for him last gameweek:

-Long term nailed.
-Great fixtures. 
-3 Assists so far.
-Great rotation player.
-Higher points ceiling than players at the same price point.

Since 5 out of 6 of my players blanked the first day of this gameweek, I'll take this score, especially as I don't own TAA.  

Gusto was a great buy for me this week, another cheap defender that provides for me this season.

Can't complain given how my team looked after last GW, transfers paid off nicely with Gusto and Doughty both returning and I avoided taking a hit, Son outscoring Salah...
Bonus points have been quite dodgy in this GW, very unfair to me
