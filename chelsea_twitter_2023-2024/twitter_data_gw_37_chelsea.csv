Jackson,"107 points - only the second time I've scored 100+ without the help of a DGW and/or a chip.
Thanks mainly to Nicholas Jackson and gambling on Saka out scoring Foden - which he did.
This is my highest ranking since GW 3.
Next week - bench boost will be active.

Jackson,"Currently set on this (-4):

Doughty -&gt; Burn
Smith -&gt; Romero
Morris -&gt; Jackson

Don’t see the upside in taking more hits as they would have to be defensive transfers and none of the other doublers are appealing. Romero is already a bit meh but there’s no one else

Current thinking:

Madueke,Searching far and wide for some spicy differential. I’ve been eyeing Madueke for the last week. Bradley/Van Hecke to Webster/Livra(maybe). That leaves me 1.5 ITB for a punt in 38. Chris Wood has Burnley. Muniz has Luton. Villa has Palace. Decisions decisions. #FPLCommunity #fpl https://t.co/keuKe0HY8L,2024-05-06,2024-05-10,Mon May 06 18:47:28 +0000 2024,208,37,0,53,0,False
Madueke,"I’m torn between these two right now. Tottenham haven’t been great, but Richarlison seems to get a goal or assist regardless of how they play.

Madueke,"Some differentials to consider for DGW37:

🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Livramento - cheap and high upside if Trippier is out

🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Madueke - cheap and seems nailed

🇧🇪 De Bruyne - tripling up on City attack could have huge upside

🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Wilson - likely to start at least once which could be enough
