If I do JWP-&gt; Mbeumo I would 7/8 attackers who are pen takers…

Quite like that given how they are currently given, Palmer after this week could be rotated with 4defenders in 12 or Archer BOU (H) in 13…

Marco Silva admits Rodrigo Muniz has given him a selection headache after recent performances. '100 per cent sure. We are analysing in training every single day, and he’s doing really well. He had a small muscle injury in pre-season, which broke his momentum.'",2023-10-29,2023-11-05,Fri Nov 03 13:47:37 +0000 2023,217,11,9,161384,0,False

Marco Silva is not expecting much change in terms of availability for the early kick-off against Manchester United. Adama Traore and Kenny Tete are training on the grass and will be a late decision. Tosin may return before the break, but Issa Diop is not back",2023-10-29,2023-11-05,Fri Nov 03 13:41:45 +0000 2023,217,11,12,161384,0,False

Silva,"Seriously folks, I'm a bit baffled! 😅 FPL isn't just Haaland; it's your whole squad's performance, with or without him. 

Many pulled off  well or lost slight ranks. Its more about the people around doing what and whatever they have him or not.

The interchanging with Grealish, quality on the ball, defensive capability, ball retention, etc. etc.
