Was tempted by Son cap but went for the boring and safe Haaland captaincy in the end.
Good luck everyone! 🤝

I expect a dreadful gameweek for Thornefighters. Two free transfers used to sell Cash and Mitoma. Bringing in Aït-Nouri and Eze. Both decent fixtures in the short term.

Nice to have a New Zealand player in my team, especially one I played a few games with when he was a teenager. 🇳🇿
