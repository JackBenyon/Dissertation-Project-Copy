♻️ 2 FTs
🏦 0.8m 

1) Rashford has to go, and it would be for any of:

Saka
Ode
Martinelli
Bowen
Mitoma
Neto

In that specific order.

2) Plan was to sell Son also but I've decided to keep for now and sell Estupinan instead, probably for Ben White.

Neto,Selling Maddison and Son feels wrong but so does selling my boy Neto. Benching Burn and no Trippier so no double jeopardy this GW. Salah and Bowen going nowhere.

Neto,"Early GW10 thoughts:

- Might finally captain Salah, in time for his blank
- Start Udogie (442) or Neto (352)?
- Does Saka for Maddison even happen anymore?!?!

Still very happy with this squad, it's just a shame everyone else keep scoring too!
