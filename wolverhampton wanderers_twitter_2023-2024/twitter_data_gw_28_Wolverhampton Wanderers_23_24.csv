Taking a hit for 11 minutes of Marcos Senesi which I will follow up with a hit to remove him 👌 

Likely Zabarnyi and Neto this week into FH29 🏖️

Neto,"DGW28 🚌 team

I’m going one of two ways:

Flekken ➡️ Neto (FH29)
or
Foden/Haaland ➡️ Morris/Bowen (no to FH29)

A part of me is leaning towards the first option!

Small green arrow which I’ll happily take. Areola was unbelievable and the decision to target Son over Solanke was the right call!

Neto,"Fancy a bit of Norberto Neto, for Bournemouth’s upcoming double #GW28?

For those #FPL managers free hitting in #GW29, @FPLMate thinks he could be a good buy, with 2 great fixtures against Sheffield United and Luton…

Neto,"Potential GW 28 move with the doubles this week. 

In ⬆️: Douglas Luiz, Doughty, Morrid
Out ⬇️: Neto, Pedro Porro, Toney

Think it’s the perfect week to make up a negative four with Luton’s double. Toney hasn’t been in form, might pick back up after GW29.
