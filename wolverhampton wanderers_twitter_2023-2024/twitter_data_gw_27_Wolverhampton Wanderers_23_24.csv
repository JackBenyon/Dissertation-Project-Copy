Stopped the bleeding for now. All the differentials came through this week except for Neto. Already made an early change for next week. #FPL https://t.co/kS44erjHm9",2024-02-26,2024-03-01,Tue Feb 27 00:45:15 +0000 2024,567,27,1,366,1,False
Neto,"Good returns for good players in mediocre teams happen when a mediocre team Plays a mediocre team. 

Eg - Bowen vs Brentford 

Eg - not Neto vs Sheffield U

Mediocre teams can't break a stubborn low block. They can go blow for blow however in space vs a fellow mediocre

Wait for Solanke news before making any moves this week. 

Could be tempted by Allison -&gt; Neto this week 

Any thoughts on this?

Hits paid off thanks to Ait-Nouri.
Going against Haaland went well but feeling like it should have been more.
Have to be satisfied as I was expecting a drop.
14pts away from top50k, looks achievable although I am not prepared well for GW29
