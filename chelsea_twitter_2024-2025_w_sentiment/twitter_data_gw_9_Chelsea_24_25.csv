Palmer,"GW 9 LAST MINUTE TIPS:

- Palmer's the best Son replacement.

- Mbeumo a GREAT Differential Captain.

- Wouldn't bench Trent or Gabriel, both can haul.

- Prefer Cunha to Solanke, Dom's still a great pick.

- While making transfers, keep a route open to Salah

Tough call putting Delap on the bench as I think he could score, but hoping my MIDs return more points.

VdB to take 1st DEF spot should I need it.

VdV is one of the best budget DEFs this season.
