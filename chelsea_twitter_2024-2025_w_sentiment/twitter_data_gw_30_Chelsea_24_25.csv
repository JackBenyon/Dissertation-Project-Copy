Enzo,"Am I crazy for not going Mateta on the WC? 

£2.5m in the bank, I have not seen one WC without him. Surely even if he does well Sarr and Eze would play a part? He didn’t seem 100% in the FA cup game imo. 

I do need to chase rank though and Evanilson is a great differential

Almost feel like I’m playing anti-FPL at this point. A Bruno 🧢 almost matches my points.

Mines subject to change depending obviously on FA cup results, but we’ll have 2 days to manage.
