Pretty happy I did that Gakpo move now 😂 shame Kluivert is sat on my bench, but I’d of never predicted that Bournemouth result, still happy to own going forward.

Already done Sanchez to Pickford, Mbeumo comes in for Gordon after the midweek games.

GW 23 Review

Huge week and a needed one after 6 weeks of middling results.  

The Jackson and Sanchez to Gakpo and Pickford were huge 20+ pt swing. 

Back inside the top 1 million as I got to decide if I prefer Salah TC this week or Southampton 28 at home, likely to roll. https://t.co/lKdCutiEXs",2025-01-26,2025-02-02,Sun Jan 26 22:51:55 +0000 2025,185,24,3,118,0,False

City lacking defensively but City still came out on top. Foden delivers yet another return. Man City have now won 4 of their last 6 PL matches. 🔵

Notes:
- SELL Sanchez (Chelsea defense have been bad)
- Haaland worth a shout as differential?

This gameweek is looking great so far! The only regret is not starting Sels over Sánchez. This is like the third time I’ve regretted the same decision, so the lesson learned: always trust Sels. 🫡
