⚫️ High on Newcastle players
🔴 NF players on bench due to matchup with Liverpool
🔵 Jackson could turn it around given fixtures/chances but poor form as of late 
😞 Wish we could fit in Roger’s 

Thoughts?

Jackson,"Thinking about Enzo—&gt;Eze 
if the price of Eze will rise i will do it but if not i will wait
I will give bruno(SOU) and Jackson(BOU) a chance this GW
I want to get gordon and a striker that scores
I will still have 1 FT
Your thoughts ?

Also i think a made a mistake selling Amad instead of Enzo 🔴

Jackson,"#GW21 plans 📲
- 1ft, £2m itb

Very unpredictable GW ahead I feel. Palace is tempting but I think Id like to see more. Isak is the obvious miss here but Jackson is due and I feel like I can roll with this team. Fancy Chelsea to avoid silly rotation and to respond.

What a bad week for me! Things become even worse after I played my wildcard. The only right decision is keep my Sels rather than Sanchez. I might use 2 transfer for next gameweek as I got 4FT now. Guess who😂

Amad punished me for not sticking with him, had to thank Sels &amp; Wood for my green arrow this week. All DEF were really poor, so does Arsenal. Still waiting for a haul from my CRY assets. https://t.co/50yghyNLcn",2025-01-05,2025-01-13,Tue Jan 07 05:23:37 +0000 2025,185,21,0,38,1,False

Keeping Mbeumo continues to pay off, Wood delivered, But my top 3 differentials (Sanchez, Jackson, Mykolenko) blanking like always, maybe I might need to do sth there.

A decent result in a tough week. Mbeumo continues to be absolutely class, while Jackson continues to be really....terrible. He's already out and looking to Ax Sanchez soon as well. Gakpo has been great but Diaz could be a problem. Time will tell #FPL https://t.co/EdsWMsxYQl",2025-01-05,2025-01-13,Mon Jan 06 22:20:48 +0000 2025,185,21,0,144,0,False
