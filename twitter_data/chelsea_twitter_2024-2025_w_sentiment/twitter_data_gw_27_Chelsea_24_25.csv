Nkunku,"#FPL #GW27 Initial thoughts

1FT + £0.5m ITB w/ FH29 planned.

Next couple of transfers likely to be...
Ødegaard 👉 Nkunku/Bowen/Eze (in GW28)
Mykolenko 👉 Muñoz/Konate

I'll want Hall/Gordon in GW30. Need to do some thinking on who I'll want to AM in GW31/32 to keep a slot free. https://t.co/aJiZumZ9RB",2025-02-23,2025-02-24,Sun Feb 23 21:12:56 +0000 2025,181,27,2,107,2,False
Nkunku,"GW26 ✅ 

Another green arrow, albeit not the biggest from 1.7m to 1.5m. 

Cunha transfer paid off and glad I have him going into this next period. 

Looking at Rogers out for ??? As my next transfer I think. Nkunku / Neto / Kluivert the main options.

Just because you are chasing rank, don’t get sucked in. The options are that you slip further behind by a lot or gain a couple of points. Boring is fine.
