Sanchez fumbling another clean sheet 🥲. Really need to set my Arsenal bias aside, that's two weeks in a row where I've benched Robinson 😅. Would've been second if I'd started him, but that's just how fine the margins are this high up!

- 53 points all out 
- Another GW that was average but could have been so much better
