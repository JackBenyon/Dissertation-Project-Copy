Lavia,"Crazy, can't imagine Lavia - Caicedo - Endo, 3 destroyers play together. This is the real CHE midfields are supposed to be looks like last season. But still MCI is better, they can handle them even without Rodri.

If it's not MCI, CHE fwd like Nkunku can haul. #FPL #FPL",2024-08-18,2024-08-24,Sun Aug 18 16:28:12 +0000 2024,174,2,0,4582,0,False
Lavia,"📢 Enzo Maresca: ""In our system, there are positions that are very important. For instance, the two holding midfielders - we have Moi [Caicedo] and Romeo [Lavia] that can play together. We can use some of the guys such as Malo [Gusto] and Reece [James]...""

Lavia,"@ZopharFPL made a very good point about Nkunku vs City. Nkunku played wide so Chelsea could accommodate - Lavia Caicedo and Enzo. Hopefully they drop one of them in the next game allowing Nkunku to move central. 

Got to give him at least another week.

Lavia,"Coming back from #CFC #MCI disappointing! From #FPL  #CFC more defensive with Colvill, Fofana, Cuceralla &amp; Gusto nailed. Sanchez at fault for goal could lose place. Enzo, Mo, Lavia, Cole nailed. Nkunku poor - Neto &amp; Jackson should start next game",2024-08-18,2024-08-24,Sun Aug 18 17:43:06 +0000 2024,174,2,0,1276,0,False

Fofana,"🟡 HAALAND

Feels a very harsh yellow card for Haaland who has to go for the shot but clips Fofana.

Fofana,"Went with Quansah &amp; Barco…#FPL

Don’t care for Barco as he will be my 4th bench ever week, but did hope for more from Quansah. Sadly I got sucked into the hype

If Quansah looks to fall in price Im looking at
⛔️ Harwood-Bellis
⚪️ Robinson
🔵 Colwill/ Fofana

Fofana,"📢 Maresca on Nkunku pre-gw1 deadline: ""...the same with Wes (Fofana) - he didn’t play the previous game but he played against Inter.

""We are trying to manage also this kind of situation, in terms of injury.""

Fofana,"Chelsea’s fixtures look promising from GW2, but the arrival of Felix adds to the already crowded attack, making it tough to pick attackers beyond Palmer. 

Defensively, though, Colwill &amp; Fofana at £4.5m, and Gusto &amp; Cucu at £5m, seem like clear picks. 

Thoughts?🤔
