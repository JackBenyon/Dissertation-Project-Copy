Petrović,"If Branthwaite and Ait-Nouri likely to start, I could still Bench Boost. 🤔

Kelleher (instead of Petrovic) to Onana/Sa/Pickford. Son to Fernandes/Garnacho/Eze. 🙄

Some single GW fixtures look good. Free hitters might miss out just going for doublers! 🫣

There are just so many options e.g

Foden could be bruno 
Gordon could be Garnacho

Gusto could be burn

Petrović,"Wildcard tinkering take 2.
I need a GK with good fixtures in GW37 (hence Petrovic) and a striker below 6.5 (hence Werner). Ideally I'd own neither of them though. And Gabriel is likely to be dropped ahead of GW37. #FPL #DGW37 https://t.co/MxOTLjdt2s",2024-04-16,2024-04-22,Wed Apr 17 11:56:26 +0000 2024,687,34,1,1411,2,False
Petrović,"The only thing I don't like about my GW34 Bench Boost is Petrovic. Would've been nicer to keep Kelleher and not have the -4. Chelsea doubles coming up though - hopefully it pays off. Minutes for Branthwaite and Ait Nouri would help! Everything crossed! 🤞

Petrović,"Plans potentially out of the window! Was hoping to Bench Boost this GW but now waiting for team news on Branthwaite and Ait-Nouri. May need to wait for GW37 instead! 😡

Kelleher needs to go but holding Petrovic seems okay Second FT would then be for Son. 🤔
