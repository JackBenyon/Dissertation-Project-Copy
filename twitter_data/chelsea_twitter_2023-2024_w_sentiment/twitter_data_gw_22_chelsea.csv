Thoughts 🤔:

Yet again I managed to chose the wrong GK, Petrovic with 10p on the bench 🤣. Defence was great this week &amp; Saka was a massive troll in an 5-0 win 🥶. But decent GW overall! 🔥

Petrović,"Chelsea's main man is definitely Palmer.   

Most of their attacks are orchestrated from the right and Palmer takes central positions at times too.  

But I think Petrovic is going unnoticed. Can be great differential, returning 10 points in last GW. 

Considering?
