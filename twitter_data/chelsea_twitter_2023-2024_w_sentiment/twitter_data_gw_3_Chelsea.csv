Terrible week. Dropped 2.3m. Didn’t want to take hits to start the season but James has changed that😒

• Diaz has been fun, but I’d still be better off if I’d gone with Mbeumo or Mitoma🙄

In my opinion yes, City didn’t give Newcastle a sniff on the weekend so there’s no reason for Pep to change.

- Pep Roulette
