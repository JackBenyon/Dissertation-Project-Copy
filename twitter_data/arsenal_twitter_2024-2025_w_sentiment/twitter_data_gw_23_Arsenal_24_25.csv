Mateta the hero! First good week in a while. Raya to Alisson already done before the price rise.

Raya,"Bus team for #GW23 - 0.4m ITB - 2FT.

If I do Jackson➡️Gakpo my only route to Mbeumo in #GW24 (who is a must) is to sell Gordon.

If I do Raya➡️Alisson I can sell Rogers or Amad instead, funded by doing Jackson➡️DCL/5.7m.

Thoughts…?! 🤷🏼‍♂️

i have exact money to go Raul -&gt; Gakpo and take 4FT into GW24  

or .... go Raya -&gt; alisson and then raul / JP -&gt; everton attacker

Raya,"GW23 bus team 🚌 

Which third Liverpool player to get is the main question this week.

My plan has been Colwill &gt; Konate and then bench Hall but he looks dangerous.

Likely my last week of double Arsenal defence and potentially go Raya &gt; Pickford next week.
