Saliba,"How do you fix this? Udogie + Bradley or Toney will go this week for a hit. Very tempted to do Salah to Bruno for a -8 hit

Regulion and Saliba will likely be gone to before GW37. I think Walker and Maguire would be ideal to bring in. Lots to think about #FPL https://t.co/tjLg9sy1H1",2024-04-21,2024-04-27,Fri Apr 26 01:23:59 +0000 2024,20,35,0,586,0,False
Saliba,Unbelievable! A Ben White brace uno😂😂 At least I got another Odegaard assist but my word I didn't expect there to be such a big points swing between White and Gabriel/Saliba smh. #FPL #ARSCHE,2024-04-21,2024-04-27,Tue Apr 23 20:29:10 +0000 2024,20,35,1,218,0,False
