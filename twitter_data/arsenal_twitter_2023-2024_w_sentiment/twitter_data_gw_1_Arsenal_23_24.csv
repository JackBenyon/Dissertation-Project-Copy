Ramsdale,"Pretty set on this.

Thoughts: 
- Not 100% sure on Foden due to minutes, can either be Madders/Martinelli
-Stones/Gabriel could be Shaw
-Pickford could be Onana (if I don’t bring in shaw) or Ramsdale (if I bring in Shaw

DCL-&gt;Joao Pedro

Saliba,"Very close to the final team. Only decisions
Shaw/Stones/Saliba
Martinelli/Maddison/Bruno

Salah thoughts still hasn’t changed. I think Kane stays and he might be essential. Can switch to Kane GW3 easily with salah in the team

Which combination would you go for?

Saliba,"#FPL twitter/youtube hive mind: 

Gabriel is essential
Saliba is not an option 
(data: @FPLFocal)

Reality: 

Saliba 4.33 pts and 21.15 BPS per start
Gabriel 3.84 pts and 19.03 BPS per start 

Saliba equally nailed, considered the better player

Saliba,"Feeling pretty set with 0.5 ITB 

Let's see how much it changes in the last 2 days 😆

0.5 ITB. 
Saliba over Gabriel is a pure vibes pick. #FPL https://t.co/AQOgEe7zO5",2023-08-05,2023-08-11,Wed Aug 09 16:43:02 +0000 2023,20,1,67,15925,14,False
Saliba,"When Zinchenko it's fit, Timber makes Gabriel minutes risk? 🤔

Last season Gabriel was the worst un the 4 def (White, Saliba, Gabriel and Zinchenko).

Saliba,"What do you think of picking Saliba rather than Gabriel?

I know about most people going for Gabriel, but i feel like Saliba is going to generate more attacking points.

Saliba,"i feel the only differential would be which arsenal's players we pick, saka alone is too few and 3 players are too many. but which one?

obvious ones after saka (&amp;Jesus) are odegaard/martinelli/trossard/havertz and gabriel/saliba/timber

that's how many i'm confused LOL

Saliba,"Foden benched😬
Ederson will start gw 1 imo
Arsenal lineup:
Ramsdale
Timber Gabriel Saliba White
Rice Partey Odegaard
Martinelli Havertz👀 Saka
Havertz at the top is interesting as he is listed as a 7.5💰mid
Interesting game for sure and come on City🩵

Saliba,"Doubt it tbh, I think for game week 1 MINIMUM, Trossard does not start

Ramsdale
White/Saliba/Gabriel/Timber
Partey/Rice
Saka/Ødegaard/Martinelli
Havertz

If Arsenal are up 2-0 by the 65, Trossard will probably come in for Kai if he has ghosted the game
