André,"Onana really does do a terrible impression of being a pro footballer.

Andre, not Amadou.

Fixtures after Man City ✅

Wolves are better than 20th. Ridiculously tough starting fixtures. And have still managed to score every game except Arsenal.

Lemina,"Goal Morgan Rogers! He passes Lemina, Hinshelwood, Kovacic &amp; Partey and is now close to having the same amount of points as Onana, Soucek, Iwobi &amp; Adama. 

What a player!!!!

Cunha,"Double Arsenal attack or defence for this run of fixtures? 

I’m leaning toward defence despite being a huge fans of Havertz, but I don’t think any player will come close to the Arsenal assets in terms of defence, meanwhile Solanke or Cunha could get close to the Arsenal #9

Cunha,"🌟 #FPL GW7 Tips 🌟:
Differentials: Look at Leif Davis (Ipswich, 2.1% owned), Brennan Johnson (Spurs, 1.6%), &amp; Matheus Cunha (Wolves, 2.3%) for unique picks. 
Captaincy: Haaland remains top, but consider Tottenham's fixtures for Son or Maddison.
