Muniz + Gibbs White -&gt; Solanke+ ESR

ESR playing as a 10 in both preseason games and scoring in both, feels low risk at just 5.5m.

Solanke's xMins should be fine, a Spurs ST at 7.5m, just feels too good to pass up.

It just makes so much sense to me to start with Bobb AND Rogers to enable Salah, Haaland, Isak, TAA, Solanke &amp; Gvardiol for the first few GW's. 

Had my doubts with Gvardiol yesterday so could become Saliba/Gabriel.
