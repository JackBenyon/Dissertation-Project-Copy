Raya,"I think I will go Isak to Watkins.

Maybe even Wood to Mateta but selling Wood would always be dangerous. 

Raya to Martinez also in my mind. 

AM24 still active on Slot. 
FH29 seems logical for my Team.
WC30 to bring back Isak &amp; co. 
TC33 (Isak)
BB36

Thoughts?

The early move from Sarr to Semenyo feels less good with Jackson/Havertz/Ndiaye serious injuries but still 3FTs to play with after Moyes - Emery.

Big solves coming in the next two days and lots of options on the table.
