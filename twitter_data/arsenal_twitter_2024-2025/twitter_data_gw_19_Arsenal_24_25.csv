Merino,I want to say to everyone that is planning to buy or have Jesus. As an Arsenal fan i am about 70% sure that he is not starting this weekend. It is the last game before the 5 yellow cards reset to 10 and Jesus is on 4. We also have Merino and Partey who needs gametime. #FPL,2024-12-28,2024-12-31,Sun Dec 29 06:00:09 +0000 2024,633,19,0,216,1,False
