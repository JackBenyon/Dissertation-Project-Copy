Raya,"GW3 Bus Team (1.5m ITB) 🚌

⚠️ Henderson
Palace defence is weaker without Andersen, Chelsea next.

⚠️ Bruno Fernandes
Unlucky to get nothing from FUL &amp; BHA but now Liverpool next.

⚠️ Murphy
Like 90% of the team, way off it.

🧐 Raya, Gordon, Palmer, Madueke, Gibbs-White

i could do Areola to Raya. but i think it's too short term, and if it's martinez, I'm not so sure he's 0.5m better than areola. 

all in all, i still plan to roll and bank 3 FT for GW4

What a comeback after a awful GW1. Palmer goes nuclear against a poor Wolves defence 🥶 Haaland twats in a hattrick ⚽️ Trent and Saliba two cleans in a row 🔒 MGW &amp; Gordon also chipping in with 11 &amp; 10 Pts💪

Bruno &gt; Palmer 
Isak &gt; Muniz 
Tempted to take a -4 like to bring in Smith-Rowe for Saka but feel it might be too early for a hit. Still need to sort out defence. Would love Porro or Saliba somehow.

Quite good but mad about dilema decision for Burn over Saliba!!! 💩
