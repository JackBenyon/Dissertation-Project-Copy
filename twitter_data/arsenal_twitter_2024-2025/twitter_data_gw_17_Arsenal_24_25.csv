Saliba and Partey both played 45 minutes while Timber played the full game🤔

Saliba,"Good Morning Everyone.. 👊🏻 

Price rises only for Saliba.

Price drops for Rogers &amp; other (non FPL options)

Very strange that Rogers dropped in price, I think it's because everyone is buying Enzo and Amad but Rogers is still a really great option for me.

Have a nice day 🫡 #FPL https://t.co/BdrnMZDJzV",2024-12-15,2024-12-20,Wed Dec 18 07:36:39 +0000 2024,18,17,7,9101,3,False
