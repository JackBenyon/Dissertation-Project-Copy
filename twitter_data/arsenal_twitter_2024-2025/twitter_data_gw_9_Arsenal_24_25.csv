Gabriel,"GW 9 LAST MINUTE TIPS:

- Palmer's the best Son replacement.

- Mbeumo a GREAT Differential Captain.

- Wouldn't bench Trent or Gabriel, both can haul.

- Prefer Cunha to Solanke, Dom's still a great pick.

- While making transfers, keep a route open to Salah

▫️1.0 GC per 90
▫️3 clean sheets in 8 apps
▫️0.21 xGI per 90

Whilst it's worrying that the likes of Timber &amp; Calafiori continue to be doubts, and Saliba suspended, Gabriel is still a massive attacking threat for ARS on set pieces.

💭Gabriel to come in if Saka doesn’t make the squad - that's fine, I'm not keen on other available options right now

P.S. I've accepted the red arrow, and still going to enjoy my weekend 😉
