Sarabia,"GW30 - 57 points. 6.6k-8.5k.

A bit of a naughty punt on RAN didn‚Äôt pay off but we take the 0.64 xG chance and run. 

Likely to buy Sarabia, Darwin and Salah tonight. #FPL https://t.co/lS8mlBURcu",2024-03-31,2024-04-01,Sun Mar 31 18:31:22 +0000 2024,570,31,12,380,0,False
Sarabia,"3x transfers used for GW31. Protecting the Gvardiol GW32 line was too appetising.

Son/Douglas Luiz/Watkins to Salah/Sarabia/Darwin.

70EV net of the hit which I hope is offset by Sarabia EV in 34. 

The game is pretty straight forward at this time of the year.

Sarabia,"61 points.

Small red:
8.9k ‚û°Ô∏è 9.4k üìâ

Debating if it‚Äôs worth taking a (-4) to keep Son for 3 GWs before WC35.

üÖ∞Ô∏è: Watkins, Son ‚û°Ô∏è Darwin, Salah
üÖ±Ô∏è: Watkins, Foden, Richarlison ‚û°Ô∏è Darwin, Salah, Sarabia (-4)

A√Øt-Nouri,"Interesting stats from @fbref about some full-backs (and Trent).

Might be the beer but I think I‚Äôm gonna drop Lascelles for Ait-Nouri right now and go to bed ü´°

Gusto has good numbers to be fair. Glad my Tweet didn‚Äôt come back to haunt me but he puts in good work.

A√Øt-Nouri,"My downslide last season started in GW30. Thereafter multiple woodwork and VAR strikes over next several weeks. Could it be the same story again?
Son, Toney, Ait-Nouri and even Salah. Extraordinary point dodging. But in the end, Red Arrow was down to the -4 hit.

A√Øt-Nouri,"71 points all out. ‚úÖ

344k OR. üåé

Successful wildcard I'd say, shame about Lascelles but that's FPL for you. 

Possible moves next week:

Saka ‚û°Ô∏è Havertz (if Saka isn't starting midweek)

Lascelles ‚û°Ô∏è Ait-Nouri.

A√Øt-Nouri,"#GW30: One of the better ones in recent weeks! 

Points: 67
Rank: 40k (Green arrow 10k)

Not having Salah really could have meant a red arrow, but luckily not!

Transfer plan: 

Out: Moreno, √òdegaard, Watkins (-4)

In: Ait-Nouri, Salah, Muniz

Thoughts?

2 free transfers &amp; ¬£4.1m ITB

Watkins/Foden to Darwin/Salah

Which would you go for?

A√Øt-Nouri,"@FPL_Harry @FPL__Raptor @FPLFocal 

Dilemma - Kiwior or Ait-Nouri? This would be replacing Saliba to allow me to bring in Salah for GW31. What are your thoughts please?

A√Øt-Nouri,"A few notable under performers for the WC30 teams. Those that took a risk with Ait-Nouri looking extremely unlucky.
