He’s stepped in for the last 2 matches when Jose Sa has been injured. 2 clean sheets and top performances too. Shows the importance and frustrations of a no.2 goalkeeper

Sarabia,"Some Observations:

WOL 1-0 BUR

- WOL edged Burnley in a game that didn’t see too many chances for either team.

- Hwang took advantage of a small mix-up between O’Shea &amp; Berge to score just before the break.

- Sarabia had a few half chances but couldn’t convert.
