Dawson,"So this is my GW17 team as it stands.. 1 FT. 0.6 ITB.

Option 1: Just roll and hope for the best
Option 2: Use FT to take out Dawson for Pau (Can't afford Porro)
Option 3: Haaland to Solanke and Dawson to Porro for a -4.

Suggestions? Castagne might not play.

Stayed calm and no hits. Not confident on Castagne starting but we'll see, I want Trippier for next GW so no Porro. Not getting rid of Haaland for Solanke either as I don't want a benching headache.
