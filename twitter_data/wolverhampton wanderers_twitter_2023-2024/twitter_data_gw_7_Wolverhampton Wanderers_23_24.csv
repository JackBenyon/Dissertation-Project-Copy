Absolute shocker of a week. Was up as high as 350k then finish 2.15m 😳

Good: very little

Bad: poor TC, not opting for Neto over Mbeumo, No Newcastle hurt, Chelsea player, benching Bowen because he was ""ill"".. 

Anyway huge red 🔻🔻🔻

Neto rotates nicely with Areola.

Would like to fit in TAA/Robbo but I can’t figure out how. Quensah could be subbed to Beyer/Gusto.

Considering J-Madz &amp; Bowen.

Would like to know the #FPL striker from Newcastle but not sure. Otherwise Alvarez. https://t.co/WCJAwI3hUq",2023-09-24,2023-09-29,Sun Sep 24 06:08:26 +0000 2023,567,7,0,8,0,False
