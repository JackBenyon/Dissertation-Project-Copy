Neto,"GW1 done. Points to note:

Chl - Chilwell 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻  Give Jackson few games
L’pool - Only Salah should be considered now
Brent - Wissa, Mbuemo &amp; Henry, all good options
MU - Defence shaky, give a week at least for Rash/Bruno/Mount
Wolves - Cunha/Neto 👍🏻👍🏻

Aït-Nouri,"9/11. Bueno and Silva both on the bench, as Joao Gomes and Ait-Nouri join the starting line-up.

Expecting a 4-4-1-1 with Sarabia behind Cunha.

Kalajdžić,"How on earth is that not a penalty for Wolves???
Onana literally missed the ball by a meter minimum and took down Kalajdzic 🤡-from refs
Wolves really good need to finish those chances.
