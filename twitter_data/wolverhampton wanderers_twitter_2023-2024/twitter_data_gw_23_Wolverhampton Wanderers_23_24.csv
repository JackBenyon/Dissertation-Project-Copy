Any ideas 💡? .. Might actually roll the transfer for like the 2nd time this season 😛 

Jota/ Gordon/ Neto/ Maddison / Haaland on the radar

Neto,"Two FTs. Want Haaland in🇳🇴 #FPL 

❌Out: Archer and Martinelli
✅In: Haaland and ❓(max $6m)

A) Neto ($5.6m)
-Gives a solid squad
-Good option for BGW26
-Harder to get Salah / Son

B) Chukwuemeka ($4.2m)
-No bench headache

Neto,"FPL tips after last nights game:

Wolves - Can’t ignore Neto. His finish was another solo stunner. RAN a threat when coming on. 

Man Utd - Credit where it’s due Rashford (1st half) was so fast. Mainoo shouldn’t be ignored or Hojlund.
