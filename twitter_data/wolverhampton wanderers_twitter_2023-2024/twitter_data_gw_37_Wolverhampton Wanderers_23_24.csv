Aït-Nouri,"Struggling what transfers to make this week. Bench boost active. Only 1 FT. Considering 

Garnacho &gt; Gordon 

Plus either 

Ait-Nouri &gt; Porro  

Or 

Gusto &gt; Cucurella 🤔.

Aït-Nouri,"The fact I kept Gusto in my starting 11 worked out, considering I had Ait-Nouri as 1st sub, who scored 0 pts.

Van de Ven could yet punish me, but I doubt it 😅

Spurs are going to get beat quite badly, I feel...

Aït-Nouri,"83 + BP - 4
2 to play

Every player except Gusto with a return, but thank god I started him because at least he got 1 pt.

Ait-Nouri got 0 pts, and VDV got -1 pt. 😅

Still have Mitchell and Onana to play, but unfortunately they play against each other.

Aït-Nouri,Transfer plan for GW37 is Garnacho &amp; ait-nouri to de bruyne &amp; Dunk for a hit. #FPL,2024-05-05,2024-05-10,Mon May 06 09:02:07 +0000 2024,545,37,0,9,0,False
Aït-Nouri,"I’m looking at taking a hit this GW to bring in a defender (replacing Ait-Nouri) to maximise my Bench Boost 🚀

Here are the Top 10 most transferred in defenders so far this gameweek 👀

Which 1 would you choose? 🤔

Aït-Nouri,"Is taking Ait-Nouri out for a -4 this week worth it on bench boost? 

I don’t think he’ll score many points but I also don’t see any defenders that’ll outscore him by 4? 🤔 #FPL",2024-05-05,2024-05-10,Wed May 08 06:17:37 +0000 2024,545,37,1,1850,4,False
