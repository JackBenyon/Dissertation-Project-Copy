Kilman,"Mo Salah's return is eagerly awaited, Ivan Toney remains unmoved and Max Kilman is described as an ""all-round nice bloke"" in our Gameweek 25 Preview.

Neto,"Bench boost, yay or nay? 💺

With Neto I expect Bournemouth to concede, with Pau I am not sure if he starts 🤔

Neto,"If you watched Newcastle defend at the start of the season, and just returned  for their last six games...

... you'd be forgiven for thinking you're watching an entirely different team

Such has been the drop off!

Think I'll be selling Dubravka for Kaminski or Neto soon

Neto,"Unsurprisingly GK’s for the 4 teams who have double gameweeks this week are top of the FPL points predictions in @FPLFocal latest video…

https://t.co/QTLtGfWdRz

Alisson would be my pick with Neto if you were wildcarding - 2 doublers in gw25+28

Kaminski ❌

Neto,"GW25 - Walker Rich➡️Lamptey KDB(-4)
GW26 - Jota VVD ➡️ Neto Moreno (-4)

It’s essentially -8 for KDB but I think if he stays fit, it’ll be worth it for next 4 GWs

KDB - CHE BRE bou MUN liv
Walker - CHE BRE bou MUN liv + 8

Neto,"I was hoping for 2 frees in BGW26.

Atm, I’m favouring TAA down to Reguillion or Pinnock? Then a single transfer for Jota to make way for Pedro Neto in 26.

Leaving me cash for Solanke to Toney after Bournemouth’s double.

Thoughts?

GW25 Trent ➡️ Reguilon (TC Haaland)
GW26 Kabore ➡️ Gabriel (9 players)
GW 27 Roll
GW 28 Turner ➡️ Neto
GW29 Watkins ➡️ Toney
GW30 Jota ➡️ Salah

Neto,"🚨🐺 This is disastrous for Wolves. 😢

Arguably our best player this season and definitely the most important to the fluidity and quality of our attack. 

Recover soon! 🙏🏻

In terms of #FPL, this significantly dents the appeal of Hwang &amp; Neto, imo.

Neto,"🚨🐺 Just a reminder of this post from November showing Cunha's importance to Wolves and how an injury to him is worse than losing Neto or Hwang. 👇🏻

And since this post, Cunha has been significantly more involved.

Massive loss. 😢

Aït-Nouri,"Current plan for next 5 weeks:

GW25 - Roll

GW26 - VVD/Jota &gt; Ait-Nouri/Saka

GW27 - Roll

GW28 - Foden/Darwin &gt; Barkley/Solanke

GW29 - (maybe free hit)

Very loose plan for now, but see how it goes 🤞
