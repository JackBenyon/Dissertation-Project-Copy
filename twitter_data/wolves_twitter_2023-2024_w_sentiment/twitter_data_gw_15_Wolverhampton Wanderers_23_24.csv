Bentley,"We could be living in an #FPL world where we could have TWO 3.9 GKs in our squads. 
Who likes the look of Martin Dubravka and Daniel Bentley‚Äôs upcoming fixtures?

üì¢ Gary O'Neil on Jose Sa injury: ""Back tightened up. Think it was the second goal, he sort of landed awkwardly. It shouldn't be serious.

""He was struggling to kick a ball...""

3rd ‚ôªÔ∏è In a row makes for some decent rank climbing

Cunha ruining what could‚Äôve been greatness ü•≤

Glad as a Spurs fan Haaland didn‚Äôt take his chances, but it could‚Äôve been a monster haul!

Cunha,"18 points with 4 players played.

Cunha got another goal in as many games and saka did it again!

Now for Liverpool to come good and Son to finish off his chances!

Hopefully I can break back into the top 100 this week.

Thoughts?
