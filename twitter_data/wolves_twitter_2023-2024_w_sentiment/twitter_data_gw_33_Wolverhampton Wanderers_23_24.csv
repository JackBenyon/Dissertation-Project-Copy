Kilman,"GW32 review #FPL 

69 points

943k ➡️ 853k 🟢 

I was 866k after GW17, I've gone via 500k and 1.6m in the meantime, that's a long way to gain 13k. 

Thankfully VAR ruled out Max Kilman's goal second on my bench. 

Nice auto sub of Zabarnyi 1 pointer 🙄

Ait-Nouri could’ve got a double digit if he only waited 5 more minutes but FPL is FPL.
