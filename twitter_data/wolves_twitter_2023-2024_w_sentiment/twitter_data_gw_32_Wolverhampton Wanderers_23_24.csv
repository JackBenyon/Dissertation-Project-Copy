Sarabia,Okay start. The sarabia thing doesn't sting as it's just 4 points between Sarabia and Solanke. Also if the switch went through I wouldn't have Nouri in the 11. #FPL #FPLCommunity https://t.co/4FOlgJPfDB,2024-04-03,2024-04-05,Wed Apr 03 06:41:09 +0000 2024,570,32,1,643,0,False

Sarabia,"@historianFPL @fplteam_ If set up 3-4-3 then I’d bench 2x doubling DEF most likely Zabaryni and Saliba. 

This would allow for an £8.0m MID option.

Options:

&gt; Olise 8.9 predicted points
&gt; Sarabia 8.3 pp
&gt; Garnacho 5.0
&gt; Bailey 5.0
&gt; Bowen 4.8

Or hold Gordon 🤔 Could then BB . . .

a 🚾 gw that started with so much promise,with an aït-nouri goal 😅 turned into tumultuous gw real quick 🤣🙈 

no saka or haaland mins + no  zabarnyi, foden or garnacho auto sub = no party 👎🏾📉

may have to lock in cold palmer cap now though!🥶

Aït-Nouri,"I sold 11 players who all blanked.

I bought White, Saliba, Diaz, Palmer, Darwin, Garnacho (autosub), Ait-Nouri (stays benched) and Haaland (enables the autosub).

Umm… I think I call that a good start for my wildcard.

91 points, green arrow from 144k to 61k.

Good start to the midweek with Ait-Nouri and Isak, but the Foden hat trick killed any hope of a green. Palmer is a king and it'll be a close call between him and the 59 minute man as to who gets the armband.

70pts 
🌍1m 🟩🟩

Good: Auto-sub 1 Garnacho, Ait-Nouri, Havertz over Saka

Bad: ©️Salah wtf man, Son was also non-existent, Liverpool conceding 

Weird week with the rested players but a decent green. So close to getting back into 1m. Better late than never

I done a poll yesterday about taking the -4 in GW31 &amp; didn’t.

Regulion won the poll so let’s hope he can do something tonight vs Brighton. That’s if he even starts after his suspension.
