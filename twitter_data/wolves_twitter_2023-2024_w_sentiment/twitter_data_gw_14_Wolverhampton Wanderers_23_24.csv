Can not complain one bit. Cash’s 0 pointer was kind of a bummer but Hee Chan scoring really brightened my mood today.

Hee Chan,"Algorithm picks for #GW14 Defenders
1. TAA Vs Fulham. Still a good pick without Alisson?
2. White Vs Wolves. Arsenal have kept 5 Clean sheets. Can they keep one Against Hee Chan and Cunha?

Gomes,"Furthermore Wolves are missing Neto, Lamina, and Gomes leaving them weak. I think also O' Neil is a confident manager who backs his team and system meaning hes more likely to come to play leaving his side potentially over.

Aït-Nouri,"47 all out GW13.

🥴Awful, just awful. And watching Son have the ball in the net 3 times but all offside was excruciating.
😔Aït-Nouri transfer a few weeks ago has turned out to be a disaster and he’s now injured.
Only a slight rank drop (5%) but simply have to do better. #FPL https://t.co/3F0fUxgV8y",2023-11-28,2023-12-01,Tue Nov 28 08:26:41 +0000 2023,545,14,2,219,2,False
