I’m not chasing points, I’ve already got #AVL players in. Cash and Diaby. They’ve got good fixtures coming in. 
Only problem is that Bruno can get in a rich vein of form.

Neto,"This could be my team if both Son and Diaby are out. 

I'd need Burnley to absolutely demolish Chelsea. 🤣

The only way out of this is Son ➡️ Neto/Mitoma for a -4, move early for one of them but that would mean losing Son vs FUL(H)

Neto could be worth it (AVL then BOU)
