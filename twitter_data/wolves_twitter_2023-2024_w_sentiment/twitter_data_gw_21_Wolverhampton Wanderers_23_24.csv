Cunha,"He is 16. in xG, on the level of Wissa and Cunha (they played less minutes tho). He has less xG than Wilson who played 728 minutes this season (Saka 1755). Per 90 minutes he is 21., on the level of Doucoure (5,5m EVE mid), Carlton Morris and McTominay.

Semedo,"My Draft season is going considerably better so I’m going to start sharing it more 😅 but I’m very much still in it!Semedo in for Coufal was HUGE — gave me the win. Doughty and Diogo J were steals (and could possibly earn places in my Classic squad 👀).

2FT this GW - no early transfers 🕑

Moving Salah out if needed or Sarabia 🤔

Gutted KDB isn't ready 🇧🇪

Let's go! 👊👊👊

Sarabia,"Sarabia vs Garnacho. I guess Pablo will be my cheap enabler for GW21-24 due to benching Salah. Also United scored more goals than Sheffield and Burnley only. Sarabia has SHU (H) in very possible BGW26. Think about it

Doyle,"It’s hard to know which decision has scuppered my #FPL season more.

Starting with double United midfield (Rashford and Fernandes), or persisting with double Arsenal defence (Gabriel and Saliba).

Either way, this season is in the bin. Struggling to even get in the top 3 million. https://t.co/MH6o0RK6ei",2023-12-31,2024-01-21,Sun Dec 31 16:59:18 +0000 2023,351,21,0,970,0,False

Toti,"So it’s 5-3-2 if we just do our one allocated transfer.

Or a -4 which would be Luiz starting in place of Toti.

Or a -4 which would still be 5-3-2 but Estu instead of Toti. 

What would you do? (Bowen = Gross btw)
