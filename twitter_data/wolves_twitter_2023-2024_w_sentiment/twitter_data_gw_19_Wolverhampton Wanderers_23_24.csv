Dawson,"2/2 I'm still very much working it out myself!! 🤠... There are some great #FPL pages to follow though. For starters, I would recommend @FPL_JianBatra  @FPLFocal  @FFScout  @Chai_FPL  as some of the many great accounts out there. They actually know what they are talking about 🫡",2023-12-25,2023-12-26,Mon Dec 25 22:02:29 +0000 2023,551,19,4,933,0,False

Sarabia,"Almost did a -4 (Trent/Sarabia in for Tsimikas/Sterling). Decided not to as I don't need to take a hit.

Tempted to sell Sterling for Foden and to also captain him. But I will wait for more information first.

Sarabia,"Sarabia, the ultimate differential, ensures a green arrow from 68k to 58k! 👏🏼🙌🏼

Next 4 moves pretty simple: Tsimikas, Son, Salah, Isak to TAA, Richarlison, Bowen and Haaland! #FPL https://t.co/TpDvBp3Ee0",2023-12-25,2023-12-26,Mon Dec 25 06:10:53 +0000 2023,570,19,2,180,0,False
