Notes: Solid bounce back week after the minor red arrow last week. Saliba transfer paid off, but Guehi ahead of Tsimikas didn’t. Green arrow and 2 FT going into intl break is handy.

Eze, Tsimikas, and Saliba performed well.

I'd like to say starting Tsimikas was pure genius, but was a necessity with Udogie suspension. 

Priority now to get Saliba, ditch Wilson/Villa and find funds for Haaland return.

Saliba,"Finally making up some ground in my mini-leagues 😅 thought I had done well captaining Salah but Haaland went and matched him anyway. That Haaland assist is a complete joke to give, mind. 

2 FTs, 0.0 itb. Current thoughts: Cash to Saliba, Diaby to Eze
