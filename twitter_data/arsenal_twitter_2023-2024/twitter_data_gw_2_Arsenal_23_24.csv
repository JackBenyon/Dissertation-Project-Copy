I’m so glad I own Martinelli and Saka; they both looked absolutely on it yesterday! Odegaard was quiet but integral; bad for #FPL in GW1. Rice had a few chances &amp; I think he’s just as good a pick as Rodri as a cheap #FPL pick.

(Assuming Rice x Partey double pivot)

Too good to be a touchline winger.

Shaw -&gt; Chilwell
Trossard -&gt; Diaby (-4)

The team is set up well, and I'm hoping to improve on last week's score of 68. -4 taken to avoid being priced out of moves in GW3.

Trossard,"GW1 Review:

Points: 68 
Target achieved.

Captain: 26 Points
Great choice.

Rank: 3,427,332

Overall, I'm happy with this start. Trossard was a poor pick but giving him one more week, which was always the idea of the risk.
Already made early move from Shaw to Chilwell!

This move is purely to get more funds. Initially, I wanted to swap Trossard for Diaz, but the price rise (and fall), means I can't.

This means next week, I can look at offloading Trossard for perhaps Maddison/Richaralison or Grealish/Foden

Saliba,"Draft GW2 team. Likely going with Salah captaincy - if not this week, then when?

Took a -8 hit:
Out: Gabriel, Timber, Richarlison
In: Chilwell, Saliba, Mitoma

Expensive but worth it - avoided the price hikes for Chilwell and Saliba, and the drop for Timber.

Happy with that, aim to have 70-75 points each week so anything above is a bonus

Stung twice by early leaks (too late for Saliba and incorrect Alvarez info) and benching’s wrong but 🤷🏻‍♂️

Rolling transfer but have a plan gw3
