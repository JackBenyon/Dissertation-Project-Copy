Martinelli,"Some #FPL managers are selling Son for Saka. Not getting the logic. Son is clearly a better asset. Haaland, Salah and Son are non negotiable. Saka might be consistent but you can get similar points from Maddison/Martinelli/Bowen/Mbeumo/Mitoma/Diaby etc.

Kiwior,"My reasoning for the Gabriel benching 👇🏽

- SHU are bottom of the league which made MA more comfortable to rotate

- B2B tough away fixtures where Gabriel had physical challenges against the opposition

- Great game to sharpen Kiwior

... I would keep Gabriel #fpl

Kiwior,"𝐆𝐚𝐛𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐥

SHU is the easiest fixture in the league, the more reason I think Gabriel and Ødegaard got rested or rotated.
I still believe Gabriel is first-choice ahead of Kiwior, so there's no need to panic-sell him.
