Havertz,"Can i bank a transfer here? Just wildcarded in 30 and already the whole bench is out. I hope White, Havertz and Bradley all start otherwise a shit gameweek is ahead.

Havertz,Do I take a -4 and do Bailey to Diaz or Havertz?! Gross on the bench.. #FPL https://t.co/w1YpMXq4uJ,2024-04-01,2024-04-02,Mon Apr 01 09:26:51 +0000 2024,6,31,0,221,0,False
Havertz,"Think I’m going to buy Havertz and cap him next gameweek. Salah’s away at Man Utd so it’s not the worst week to do it. 

Decisions like these usually don’t swing too hard so think it’s a decent gamble.

Saliba,"We’ve tried to cover some different names, eg Konsa and VVD for chip strategies etc. Is there anyone else we’ve missed here? Names like Gabriel, Saliba, Spurs def or a Chelsea defender with a double, double to come. Let us know but we hope it helps.

Saliba,"The great reset has started well but never got the Salah advantage I hoped for.

Tempted to not bring Saka in for Maddison (original plan) &amp; Start Muniz in GW31🤔

Lessons: Saliba is not to be benched!
