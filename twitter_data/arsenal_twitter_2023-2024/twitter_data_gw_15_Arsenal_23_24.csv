Saka,"GW14 review 

Returns for Saka, Salah, Watkins, Mbeumo, Haaland, and Alvarez and clean sheet for Mykolenko help me beat this week's average 😊⚽️👍 

Arsenal and Newcastle defence the plan and also Bowen to Gordon to help boost funds 😊👍

At the beginning of the season I set myself a target: top 50K by GW19, it seems realistic now.

Lessons after 14 GWs:

1) Trippier, Son, Saka, Watkins are probably a set and forget this season.

2) We should really stop expecting GK clean sheets.
