If Haaland does come in this GW...

I could do Tsimikas ➡️ Trent/Colwill/Zinchenko for GW19, but that locks in a -4 in GW20. 🫠 If not, I’ll play Archer.

Bought a player I am benching, but with the short turnaround it feels good having a bench.

Could still make a last minute 1st 11 switch from Saliba to Porro though, feels like a close call.

The two last minute decisions to:
