Leaning back towards double Arsenal defence, Robinson drops to the bench.

He has easy fixtures &amp; #DGW24 and is currently scoring in almost every game.

Cunha,"Disappointed with missing Mitoma’s 12 points on GW22 but overall a good week.

GW23 thinking of going 4-4-2

Isak (C)

Three Liverpool players I feel is a must going into the upcoming fixtures. 

Cunha and Palmer to be benched.

Solanke ➡️ Wood

Gvardiol ➡️ Van Dijk
