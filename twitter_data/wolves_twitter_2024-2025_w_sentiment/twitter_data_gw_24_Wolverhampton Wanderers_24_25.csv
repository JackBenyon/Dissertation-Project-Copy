Gomes,"#DGW24 tips except Livepool and Everton:

🥇Rogers

If you have him keep him this week because João Gomes got red card last week with his missing it will be more space for Rogers and he may score a goal or even haul!

Gomes,"Who would you guys start this week? 

Gordon or Rogers 😮‍💨

Tight one for me but leaning Rogers due to the Joao Gomes suspension. Fulham are a tough team but Newcastle at home are always a solid prospect in terms of goals ⚔️
