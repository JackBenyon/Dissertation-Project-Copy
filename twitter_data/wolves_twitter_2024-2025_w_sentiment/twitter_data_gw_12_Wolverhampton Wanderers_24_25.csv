Lewis ➡️ Colwill or Veltman

I have the exact funds for the above transfers though 🥲 and I just can’t make early transfers.

Aït-Nouri,"#FPL #GW11 Review

©️ - Haaland🤦🏽‍♂️
🌍 - 665k
🐝 - Gotta love Wissa, 4 attacking returns since I bought him
👺 - Downgrading TAA &amp; Porro to bring in Bruno certainly feels like it paid off.
🐺 - Ait-Nouri CS😳
👀 - Lewis Hall(primary🎯) &amp; Lukasz Fabianski(secondary🎯)

Alisson ✅
Gabriel&amp;Saliba, Ait-Nouri ✅
Rogers, Mbeumo, Salah, Palmer ✅
Jackson, Isak, Watkins ✅

Fabiański, Semenyo, Hall and 4.0 defender. 0.3 ITB 🏦

Ait-Nouri 
Hall
Mazraoui
Kerkez
Robinson
Colwill
Harwood-Bellis

Should I be thinking about anyone else?

Arsenal and City defence no longer appeal to me

Aït-Nouri,"Good morning #FPLCommunity! 👋

How’s #GW11 going?

48pts for me so far with Sels, Gabriel, Johnson and Palmer to play.

My Wolves double-up of Cunha and Ait-Nouri the heroes from yesterday!

Just remember, however your #FPL weekend is going, this guy’s weekend is worse!!! 😉 https://t.co/famNwskk9P",2024-11-10,2024-11-22,Sun Nov 10 07:36:26 +0000 2024,533,12,1,851,2,False
Aït-Nouri,"I'm leaning towards Ait-Nouri as my TAA replacement.

I need to go under 5.2m and no one really catches my eye at that price.

Every team conceedes goals so trying to find an attacking minded defender.

Digne is there also, but if you know you know...
