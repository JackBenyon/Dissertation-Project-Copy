Quite happy with this team. A few options:

- Semenyo to Buonanotte
- Robertson to Ait-Nouri?
- DCL to  Wissa? Strand Larsen?

Semenyo gets chances, Robbo is facing a depleted Arsenal and DCL.. hes shit but Ive come too far. Leaning towards rolling.

Aït-Nouri,"I could also downgrade Semenyo to Buonanotte and keep Trent, but I think Ait-Nouri could potentially be essential in the coming weeks.

Interesting week ahead, all rests with Saka before decisions are made.

Don't think I'll triple Captain Haaland, but yet to be decided 🤔

Aït-Nouri,"43pts for #GW8

Ok score in a low scoring game week gets me a good green arrow.

Considering using my three transfers and saying 👋 to Trent, Kai and ESR and 🤝 to Ait-Nouri, Raul and Son… or rolling a (PB) 3rd time 😂

Hope you had a good game week.
