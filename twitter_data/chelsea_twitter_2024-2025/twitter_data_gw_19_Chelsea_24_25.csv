Palmer,"GW18: 69 points

A seventh consecutive green arrow takes me up to 166k.

Clean sheets for Verbruggen and my double Arsenal defence were the highlights.

Palmer, Salah and Isak continue to deliver.

Will likely be rolling a transfer in GW19.

Plan to sell Jackson or Pedro for Isak and/or Cucurella for Trent. Could also do Martinez to Aina/Milenkovic.

- Surviving Jackson's blank week after week feels good. Unsure about moving into him now.
- Might be a week I would do a GK transfer.
- Or... just roll as long as Cunha isn't banned yet.

Mbeumo might fit in, but which defender gets benched? Could be a late decision.
