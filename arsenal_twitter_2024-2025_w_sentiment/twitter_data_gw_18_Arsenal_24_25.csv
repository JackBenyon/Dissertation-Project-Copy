Ødegaard,"Many are talking about Ødegaard taking penalties as Saka’s replacement, but he will be on corners too, and that’s way more important! 😅

Ødegaard,"Before Saka's injury, were you even considering Bruno or Ødegaard? That’s my dilemma now, I’ve never been that interested in either of them. The injury doesn’t really change that for me. You could make a case for Bruno, maybe, but Ødegaard? Not really.
