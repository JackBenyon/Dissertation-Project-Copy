Raya,"#GW26 Transfer Plans:

I’m likely to make 3 transfers this week.

Arteta is currently the front runner to replace Emery, but I’m also tempted to chase table bonus for the third time and go with Glasner.

My other two planned moves are:

Rogers -&gt; Nwaneri
Alisson -&gt; Raya

- Small red arrow 🔺️
- Decent week considering no 🍟
-Salah is the 🐐 
-Mbuemo and Palmer bring more disappointment 😭
- Holding Raya not so bad.. 🛡🛡
- Gakpo 😭🤕

Looking to move on Gakpo and focus on covering blank GW29

Merino,"Who’s the better Amad replacement for #GW26?

⚡️ Nwaneri - likely to start and play 90 mins. Looked sharp against LEI and confidence is high. 

⚽️ Merino - assuming will start and goal threat as a 9.
