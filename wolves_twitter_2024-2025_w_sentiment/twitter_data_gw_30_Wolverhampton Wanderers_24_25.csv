André Onana is facing a late fitness test ahead of the game later on tonight. As it stands. He’s not playing.

Agbadou,"🚨 The Best Wild Card Draft Ever 🚨

-- Without Haaland Team looks Great.

-- I know Newcastle United &amp; Crystal Palace midfielders aren't there.

-- All Penalty Takers are in the team 🤌

-- you can change :-

     Quansah 🔁 Agbadou
     Marmoush 🔁 Wood

Got the 50/50's all wrong with Kluivert over Bellegarde, CHO over Elanga, Haaland over Marmoush and Haaland captaincy over Bruno.

Down 40k. Basically ended up playing with 7 🙄

• If I’d have sold Palmer and not Mbeumo I would’ve got Marmoush/Elanga instead of Beto/Bellegarde. 21 point difference. I just keep losing more pts to other close decisions 🤷🏼‍♂️
• Bellegarde haul though 🤪
