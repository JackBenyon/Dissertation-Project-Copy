Cunha and Isak: Heroes 🙌
Goalkeeper's situation hurts but it is what it is.
I gambled on Jota because I thought other options were shit (I was right ✔).

Thoughts 🤔:

My 50/50 call to start Rogers ahead of Hall went bad. Haaland can't even score a penalty these days. Cunha, Verbruggen &amp; Timber did good 😍. On to GW19! How did yall do?

💭 Why do I still own Haaland? That's it. That's the review.

Cunha,"GW18 finished!

Benched Sels ❌ 
Sold Cunha for Jesus ❌ 
Sold Saka to a benched Diaz ❌ 
Sold Kerkez to TAA ❌ 

Every marginal decision went badly resulting in a big red arrow.

Don’t like my team but plan to roll next GW and be patient

Cunha,"A few managers unwillingly  sold Cunha for Isak in #GW18  for a hit because they saw 'Y' number of FPL content creators do it.

Another reason to make trust your judgement and not follow anyone blindly to ""gain a good rank""

Cunha,"Why's it funny when someone pretends on X to be the FA, causing lots of #FPL managers to transfer out Cunha as they think he's banned when he's not, but it's outrageous &amp; awful when someone else (me) pokes fun at a guy who charges people to watch videos of him walking his dog?",2024-12-27,2024-12-28,Fri Dec 27 17:25:12 +0000 2024,541,19,219,8457,25,False
Cunha,"So Saka &gt; Bruno… I tried to play it safe. 

Try safe again or mix it up? 

One of these or something else?

If I get Trent, it will be 4-3-3 this week. I also have one eye on Cunha ban 🤦‍♂️

Other suggestions welcome!

Cunha,"#FPL

The Arsenal game did me well and pushes the team into the top 20k, 5th green arrow in a row. 

Hall of shame set of transfers this GW and will most definitely cause issues in the future, but at the end of the day one must truly live before they can die.
