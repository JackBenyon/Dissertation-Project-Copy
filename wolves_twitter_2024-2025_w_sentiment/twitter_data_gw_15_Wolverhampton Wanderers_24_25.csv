Mo and Trent have gone with the wind, so it's Ait-Nouri and Chris Wood time. 
Palmer captain, obviously.
Good luck everyone and enjoy your weekends!

 Saliba's 🍑 compensated for getting Ait-Nouri off the bench.

Aït-Nouri,"Am I doing the right thing benching both Cunha &amp; Ait-Nouri for the game against West Ham on Monday night? Got beat 4-0 to Everton on Wednesday &amp; as much as West Ham are struggling, they are a better side than the Toffees. #FPL #FPLCommunity #WWFC https://t.co/ECsHhqUkZA",2024-12-05,2024-12-08,Fri Dec 06 12:27:21 +0000 2024,533,15,0,455,0,False

Aït-Nouri,"Minimal attacking return potential and Wolves just could not keep a CS lately

Ball went to the net 6 times with 4 goals counted against a previously goalless Everton

I might sell Ait-Nouri prematurely before GW17 #FPL https://t.co/SgYBUmx5u9",2024-12-05,2024-12-08,Thu Dec 05 10:40:43 +0000 2024,533,15,0,136,0,False
