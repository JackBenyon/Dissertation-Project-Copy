Sánchez,"📢 Maresca on Sanchez: ""I am happy for Robert, for the defence, for all the team because probably the reason we had a clean sheet on Saturday [vs West Ham] is because Nicolas [Jackson] and Cole [Palmer] pressed very high and very good.""

Sánchez,"Gameweek 5 -&gt; 84 points

A decent gameweek. I consider salah as captaincy fail, haaland outscored him in a tougher fixture. 
The goalkeeper situation keeps me awake at night🤣 both sanchez and onana has accumulated 20+ points in 2 gameweeks whereas my gk has 3 points. #FPL #GW5 https://t.co/bU2oas6RRX",2024-09-22,2024-09-27,Mon Sep 23 13:33:10 +0000 2024,185,6,1,73,1,False

7. Sanchez/Colwill (4.5m)
8. Wood/DCL

Last thoughts -&gt; Wood and Semenyo would be my go to cheap enablers. Let me know your thoughts #FPLCommunity",2024-09-22,2024-09-27,Mon Sep 23 16:08:59 +0000 2024,185,6,3,46,1,False

• Salah captaincy a bit meh
• Trent and Sanchez with big points 
• Rogers finally returning 
• Aina and Mykolenko 😬

GK: Sanchez (Fabianski)
DEF: TAA, Gabriel &amp; gamble on Lewis with Greaves and Mykolenko as rotating budget back-ups

All others can take a walk ✌️

Tosin,"Two FPL positives last night while everyone complained that Nkunku never starts:
1. Tosin rested a regular starter Chelsea Def at 4.4??
2. Sancho rested, Neto played. Clear preference for premier league games with Sancho

4 FT 

Typical transfers would be : 

Salah to Saka
Fofana to Gabriel
Flekken to Raya
