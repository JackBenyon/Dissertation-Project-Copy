Sánchez,"57 pts all out. 😐

Everyone in attack blanked except for Salah, would've been a disaster if I didn't get captaincy right.

4 attacking blanks vs LEI(H) IPS(H) AVL(H) is crazy. 🤣

Can't blame myself for benching Livra but should've started Sanchez ""just in case"".

Sánchez,"Just made 3 transfers. 
🔄 TAA to Murillo
🔄 Palmer to Bruno
🔄 Cunha to Wood

No Haaland or Gvardiol to me. 
If Sanchez plays i should have full 11.

No idea how. I haven’t captained Salah for the last 3 GWs and I’ve still managed green arrows ✅
