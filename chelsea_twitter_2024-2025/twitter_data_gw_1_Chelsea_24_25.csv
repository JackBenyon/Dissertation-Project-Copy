Key points:
1. Salah &amp; Haaland (For Cs)
2. Best 2 attacking RBs
3. Five talismen in good teams (Salah, Haaland, Isak, Eze, MGW)
4. Quality players (Nkunku, Joao Pedro) in attacking teams
5. Perfect rotating fixtures for Mykolenko, Robinson

Nkunku,"🦁 Could we be overlooking a starting £5.0M forward for a big 6 side?

Marc Guiu started all but one of Chelsea’s preseason fixtures and did OK. Scoring and Assisting once. 

However, in the game he did not start Nkunku started in the 9. 

Worth the risk for £5.0M?

Jørgensen,"Sánchez - £4.5m

Between Jørgensen and Sánchez, I think Sánchez starts as Chelsea's number 1 GK for now. 

But with City in GW1 and a shaky defense in preseason (so many errors at the back), it's tough to trust. 

Who's your Chelsea defensive pick?

Assuming Sanchez is currently the first choice for #Chelsea. Plus Nkunku.
Double #Newcastle with Murphy over Gordon - I’ve been promoting this move for quite a while. 
Double #Fulham and still considering ESR who impresses in first https://t.co/XY0dCs2qIa",2024-08-11,2024-08-17,Sun Aug 11 10:11:24 +0000 2024,185,1,2,825,0,False
Sánchez,"Sánchez - £4.5m

Between Jørgensen and Sánchez, I think Sánchez starts as Chelsea's number 1 GK for now. 

But with City in GW1 and a shaky defense in preseason (so many errors at the back), it's tough to trust. 

Who's your Chelsea defensive pick?

Sánchez,"Raya/Sanchez* gk rotation pairing.
Not normally a fan of rotation pairings for gks.
However,at £10m for 2 top teams,this is enticing:
GW1:Raya(WOL)
GW2:Sanchez(Wol)
GW3: Raya(BHA)
GW4:Sanchez(Bou)
GW5:Sanchez(Whu)
*Sanchez expected to start, but Jorgensen could also play.
