Jackson-I feel a benching is due in Ispwich game and should I go there?

Jackson,"I’ve taken a -4 this GW because I’m really expecting some sides to rotate, namely Chelsea, which means Jackson, Palmer could be on the bench. I’ve done:

Saka ➡️ Foden
McNeil ➡️ Kulusevski

Jackson,"Thoughts on these transfers? 

Diaz isn’t a guaranteed starter, but huge upside I think (if he does start). I’d even expect points off the bench if he doesn’t.

Jackson is Jackson - isn’t the most consistent but gets chances and has a decent fixture run

Kicked Strand Larsen and Saka out of the squad yesterday.

Diaz &amp; Jackson are the new additions.

Jackson,"GW18 🚌 Team with 1 FT available.

Likely to do Saka ➡️ Bruno (Enzo 🪑)

If Cunha is out I’m not sure I want to take a hit this week so I’ll let Enzo come off the bench. 

Likely to bring in one of Mateta/Solanke/Jesus/Jackson/Wood 🔜

Finally a big score to be happy about! Rank still 🗑️ but still have to take the small wins. 

Sanchez haul, super lucky ESR omission from Fulham squad for a Rogers 14 pointer, and of course Salah captain haul!
