Went early with the Solanke transfer but I’m confident he’ll start, and if not good to hold for the double next week.

🌎 150k to 86k!! BOWEN ❤️ 
6th Green in a row ✅

Vacation mode so it’s a lazy/unassuming transfer before a trip to Abu Dhabi. Switch off! 

Saliba in for Estupinian🫡
No hits 

Captain Haaland 🧢
GOOD LUCK

Saliba,"So far in #GW27 #FPL:

Dubravka 7 (Areola 13 &amp; Doughty 5 on my bench annoying but we move)
Gross 1
Son 7
Watkins 13

Could be better
Could be worse

Still got the most important player to play: Illia Zabarnyi 🍒 v Burnley (0.4%)

Plus:
🧢 Haaland (hatty)
Foden (hatty)

Saliba,"#FPL GW27 Team 🔒

1 FT - Estupinan ➡️ Saliba

My chip strategy - FH29, WC35, BB 37

Will use FTs to setup for DGW34. This allows me to pick good players from good teams for next few GWs - think only a limited % of FPL players will do this 😝
