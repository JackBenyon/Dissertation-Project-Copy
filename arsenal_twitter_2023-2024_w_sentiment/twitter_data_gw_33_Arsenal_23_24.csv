Easy! Waiting until after the UCL/Europa to be safe.

Saliba,"2 FTs and on the fence about my moves, especially 3rd Arsenal asset.

Leaning towards 2x ARS defense—and maybe the slightly riskier White over Saliba—but Havertz as differential is tempting.

Son/Estu to Diaz/White is how I lean tho—gets me to 3x LIV/ARS with no hits.
