Pretty obvious that Saliba over Gabriel would have put me high up the leaderboard. 

Question is, do I keep Gabriel?

Keeping MU assets for one more week.

Expecting Jackson to score his 1st goal in GW3.

🔴Henry is doing well but has the hardest fixtures

🔴 Saliba has to play United but they aren't firing
