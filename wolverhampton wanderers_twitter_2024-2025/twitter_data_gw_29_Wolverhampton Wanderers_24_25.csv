Agbadou,"Current GW29 Bus Team #FPL
Budget: 0.3m
FT: 3

The plan is short-term transfers &amp; wildcard in GW31... possible transfers right now are:

CHO/Elanga in for Rogers
Hujisen/Agbadou in for Greaves. https://t.co/BdyPdDnYxu",2025-03-09,2025-03-14,Mon Mar 10 09:10:33 +0000 2025,720,29,0,152,0,False
Agbadou,"Gw29 transfer plans! 
Mateta to haaland, palmer to kluivert and Trent to Ait nouri 
If dango doesn’t start in gw28 and I don’t think he’ll start in gw29 I’ll do 
Mateta to haaland, palmer to kluivert, Trent to agbadou and dango to Semenyo (-4) 
Buy a Palace player in gw30!

Agbadou,"GW29 Blank GW Dilemma 👀

Used my 1 free transfer to sell Trent to Agbadou- £3.5m in bank

Option 1: Play Palmer, Wissa(no point deduction) 
Option 2: Sell them both for Haaland &amp; Garnacho or another 5.9 m Midfielder for a -8 hit

4/3 FT (-4).
I can't escape the hit or i'll risk Dango minutes.

Any suggestions ?

Watkins ⏩ Haaland

For -4 and 11 Players in BGW29 I think I'll do: 
Ndiaye ⏩ Strand Larsen

It's basically a -2 if Larsen blanks but I think there's a good chance he'll get a return against Southampton.

I'll dine off that transfer for years to come!
