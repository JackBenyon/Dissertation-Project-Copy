50 points 

OR drop from 88k to 442k. This season is bonkers. 

Only sold Palmer for Salah 2 weeks ago, think I might be reversing that this week and going for Diaz as my 'pool player. 

Shout out to André Onana. 22 points in 2 GWs. https://t.co/g9dHV0YORn",2024-09-22,2024-09-27,Mon Sep 23 12:27:24 +0000 2024,642,6,4,22,1,False

Aït-Nouri dropping in price makes this affordable for me.
