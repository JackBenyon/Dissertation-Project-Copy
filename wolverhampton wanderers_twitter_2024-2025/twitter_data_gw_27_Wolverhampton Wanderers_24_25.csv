©️ Captain: Palmer 

🔀FT: Ndiaye 👉🏻 Cunha 

👔AM: Arteta 

✍🏻 Palmer is my captain and I know he's a risky pick but I have a feeling he's the best choice this week.

Good luck all ❤️

Back in the top 1K. Captain Salah and have peace of mind. 

Glasner did the most.

Wood provided a nice farewell gift.

GW 27 transfer plan: Wood → Cunha.

100 on the nose. Massive green arrow even with Slot, Emery, Wood, Cunha and Munoz all doing damage.

Glasner punt went perfectly.

Cunha,"I'm seriously considering Cunha as a replacement for JP. Great fixtures, in form, nailed, on penalties, and only 12.6% owned. Plus, he plays in GW29.
